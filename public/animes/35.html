        <p>Dou Zhan Tianxia (Fight for the Throne)
Dou Zhan Tianxia is a fast-paced, martial-arts CGI donghua set in a kingdom torn apart by power struggles. It stars Dafeng—the righteous orphan—and Li Huamei, whose royal connection pulls them into deadly palace intrigue. With bite-sized weekly episodes, scheming aristocrats, and high-stakes action, it offers a neat blend of fantasy drama and short-form storytelling.

In a fractured realm following the disappearance of the Celestial Emperor, multitudes vie for power. The orphan Dafeng, a martial prodigy, saves the gravely ill Li Huamei, only to discover his senior sister is none other than Queen Qin Zhao, who relentlessly targets Li Huamei. Together, Dafeng and Li Huamei uncover treacherous palace conspiracies, navigate assassins, form key alliances, and race to unravel the web behind the throne.</p>
