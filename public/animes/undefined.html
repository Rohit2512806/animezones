I couldn’t find a fully reliable, official English-synopsis that matches “The Dragon Spirit” — many listing pages are minimal or not fully translated. That means details like main character name, exact plot summary, scope (episodes planned) are somewhat unclear publicly (or maybe just not translated from Chinese yet).</p>
