          <p>Set 10,000 years after the events of Soul Land 1, the Tang Sect has fallen into decline. A new generation rises, led by Huo Yuhao and Tang Wutong (daughter of Tang San and Xiao Wu). This group—the future "Seven Monsters of Shrek"—aims to restore the Tang Sect's former glory, facing soul beasts, dark secrets, and powerful adversaries on their epic journey.
A next‑generation tale: Huo Yuhao, Tang Wutong, and their allies strive to resurrect the Tang Sect—facing spirit beasts, sect politics, and hidden mysteries.</p>
