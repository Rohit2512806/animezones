          <p>Ling Tian, once a legendary Sword Saint, defied the Heavens to save his love—only to fall and die alongside the Heavenly Dao. Reborn 300 years before his death at the moment of his demise, he awakens anew. Now, with his beloved still alive and old allies and enemies present, he seizes this second chance to reshape destiny, reclaim his power, and chart a path to true Sainthood
